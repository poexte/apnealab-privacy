### Privacy Policy 

# What, when, and how we collect data

When you create an account, we collect your email and encrypted password. Afterward, you have the option to provide a display name and a profile picture.

Additionally, when you're logged in and using the app, we collect and process data related to your breathing activities.

# Why we collect the data

Your email is collected to verify your identity, assist with password resets, and for important non-commercial communication.

When you're logged in, we collect data on your breathing activities to provide you with progress reports and insights into your exercise habits. This collection is optional - you have the freedom to use the app without logging in.

# How we use your data

Your data is used to enhance your user experience, provide you with personalized exercise reports, and improve our app's functionality. We do not use this data for marketing or advertising purposes unless explicitly permitted by you.

# Storage and security of data

All data collected is securely stored within the EU using Google Firebase, which is fully GDPR-compliant. You can read more about Google Firebase's privacy practices here: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy.

We employ robust security measures to ensure the protection and integrity of your data. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and while we strive for maximum security, absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

# Data sharing and third-party services

We do not share your data with any third parties unless explicitly permitted by you. If in the future, we engage any third-party services that have access to your data, we will update this policy accordingly.

# Access to and deletion of data

You have the right to access all the data we hold on you. Furthermore, if you wish to delete your data, you can do so in the app by deleting your account or individual activities. If any issues arise, you can reach out to contact@apnealab.app for assistance.

# Data retention policy

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our services. If you wish to terminate your account, we will delete all data associated with it.

# Policy towards children

Our app is not intended for individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such data.

# Changes to our privacy policy

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Should any changes occur, we will inform you via the email you provided during registration.
